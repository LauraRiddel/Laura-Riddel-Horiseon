# Laura-Riddel-Horiseon
Amended code for Horiseon Marketing Services

Changes made:

Incorporated in a reset CSS stylesheet
Changed website title. Opted to use 'Marketing Services' in the page title opposed to the full business name, I felt this better described Horiseon's business activities.
Included source and alt attributes for images
Condensed CSS code and deleted unncessary / reppetitive code
Tested and repaired links

**note to the examiner - unable to correct image size of article content
